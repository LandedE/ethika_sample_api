## Design Decisions

-This project is using MongoDB for the backend hosted with mLab.

-The ODM library Mongoose is also used.

-The models directory has the users schema defined in Users.js

-The endpoints are defined in routes/ which is exposed to the main app.js file with
the module reveal pattern.
